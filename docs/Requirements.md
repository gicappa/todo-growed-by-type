## 2. Business Rules and Constraints

### 2.1 Capacity Management
- Cannot add items when board is at maximum capacity
- Capacity can be increased but never decreased below current item count
- Board deletion only allowed when empty or by owner

### 2.2 Item State Transitions
Backlog → InProgress → Review → Done ↓ ↓ ↑ Blocked

- **Valid Transitions**:
    - Backlog → InProgress
    - Backlog → Blocked
    - InProgress → Review
    - InProgress → Blocked
    - Review → Done
    - Review → InProgress
    - Blocked → InProgress
    - Blocked → Backlog

### 2.3 Time Constraints
- Due dates must be in the future when set
- Completed date must be after created date
- Sprint dates must not overlap for the same team
- Items cannot be created with future timestamps

### 2.4 Work In Progress (WIP) Limits
- Maximum items in InProgress: configurable per board (default: 5)
- Maximum items in Review: configurable per board (default: 3)
- WIP limits cannot be violated when moving items

## 3. User Management

### 3.1 User Authentication
- Unique username: non-empty, alphanumeric + underscore
- Email address: must be valid format
- Password: minimum 8 characters, must contain uppercase, lowercase, number
- Session management with timeout

### 3.2 Authorization
- Board owners can: modify board settings, add/remove collaborators, delete board
- Collaborators can: add/edit/complete items, view all board data
- Public boards: read-only access for authenticated users
- Private boards: access only for owner and collaborators

## 5. Query and Reporting Requirements

### 5.1 Basic Queries
- Find items by priority level
- Find items by assignee
- Find items by tags (contains, exact match)
- Find items by due date range
- Find completed items in date range
- Find overdue items

## 6. Data Persistence and APIs

### 6.1 Storage Requirements
- All data persisted in filesystem or database
- Atomic operations for multi-item changes
- Audit trail for all item state changes
- Backup and restore capabilities

### 6.2 REST API Endpoints
- GET /boards # List user's boards 
- POST /boards # Create new board 
- GET /boards/{id} # Get board details 
- PUT /boards/{id} # Update board settings 
- DELETE /boards/{id} # Delete board (if empty)
- GET /boards/{id}/items # List board items 
- POST /boards/{id}/items # Add new item 
- GET /items/{id} # Get item details 
- PUT /items/{id} # Update item 
- DELETE /items/{id} # Delete item 
- POST /items/{id}/transition # Change item state 
- GET /query # Execute complex queries  
- GET /metrics/velocity # Team velocity metrics

## 7. Performance Requirements

### 7.1 Response Times
- Board loading: < 200ms for up to 100 items
- Item creation/update: < 100ms
- Query execution: < 500ms for complex queries
- Real-time updates: < 50ms propagation delay

### 7.2 Scalability
- Support up to 1000 items per board
- Support up to 100 boards per user
- Support up to 10 concurrent users per board
- Handle up to 1000 concurrent system users

## 8. Error Handling and Validation

### 8.1 Client-Side Validation
- Form validation with immediate feedback
- Prevent submission of invalid data
- Clear error messages for constraint violations
- Offline support with sync when reconnected

### 8.2 Server-Side Validation
- All business rules enforced on server
- Idempotent operations where possible
- Graceful degradation for partial failures
- Detailed error codes for API consumers

## 9. User Interface Requirements

### 9.1 Board View
- Kanban-style board with columns for each state
- Drag-and-drop for state transitions (respecting rules)
- Visual indicators for WIP limit violations
- Color coding by priority and due date status

## 10. Configuration and Customization

### 10.2 System Configuration
- Default capacity limits
- Session timeout settings
- Email notification templates
- Backup schedule and retention

## 11. Integration Requirements

### 11.1 Import/Export
- Export board data to JSON/CSV
- Import items from CSV with validation
- Backup/restore individual boards
- Integration with external calendar systems for due dates

### 11.2 Notifications
- Email notifications for assignments and due dates
- Webhook support for external integrations
- Slack/Teams integration for team notifications
- Mobile push notifications (future)

## 12. Security Requirements

### 12.1 Data Protection
- All passwords hashed with salt
- Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- HTTPS required for all API endpoints
- Input sanitization to prevent XSS/injection

### 12.2 Access Control
- Role-based permissions (Owner, Collaborator, Viewer)
- API rate limiting per user
- Session invalidation on security events
- Audit log for sensitive operations



## Implementation Hints

### Compile-Time Guarantees
- Impossible to violate capacity constraints
- Invalid state transitions prevented at compile time
- Array bounds checking for all indexing operations
- Type-safe query results with size preservation

### Runtime Validation
- All external input validated before processing
- Database constraints match type system constraints
- Graceful handling of constraint violations
- Clear error messages for type mismatches

## Testing Requirements

### Property-Based Testing
- Invariant preservation across all operations
- State machine property verification
- Capacity constraint testing with random inputs
- Query result correctness verification

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end workflow testing
- Multi-user collaboration scenarios
- Performance testing under load
- Security penetration testing

## Deployment and Operations

### Environment Support
- Development, staging, and production environments
- Container-based deployment (Docker)
- Database migration system
- Configuration management

### Monitoring and Logging
- Application performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- User activity analytics
- System health dashboards
