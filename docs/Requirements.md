### 2.1 Capacity Management
- Cannot add items when board is at maximum capacity
- Capacity can be increased but never decreased below current item count
- Board deletion only allowed when empty or by owner

### 2.2 Item State Transitions
Backlog → InProgress → Review → Done ↓ ↓ ↑ Blocked

- **Valid Transitions**:
  - Backlog → InProgress
  - Backlog → Blocked
  - InProgress → Review
  - InProgress → Blocked
  - Review → Done
  - Review → InProgress
  - Blocked → InProgress
  - Blocked → Backlog

### 2.3 Time Constraints
- Due dates must be in the future when set
- Completed date must be after created date
- Sprint dates must not overlap for the same team
- Items cannot be created with future timestamps

### 2.4 Work In Progress (WIP) Limits
- Maximum items in InProgress: configurable per board (default: 5)
- Maximum items in Review: configurable per board (default: 3)
- WIP limits cannot be violated when moving items

## 3. User Management

### 3.1 User Authentication
- Unique username: non-empty, alphanumeric + underscore
- Email address: must be valid format
- Password: minimum 8 characters, must contain uppercase, lowercase, number
- Session management with timeout

### 3.2 Authorization
- Board owners can: modify board settings, add/remove collaborators, delete board
- Collaborators can: add/edit/complete items, view all board data
- Public boards: read-only access for authenticated users
- Private boards: access only for owner and collaborators

## 4. Query and Reporting Requirements

### 4.1 Basic Queries
- Find items by priority level
- Find items by assignee
- Find items by tags (contains, exact match)
- Find items by due date range
- Find completed items in date range
- Find overdue items

## 5. Data Persistence and APIs

### 5.1 Storage Requirements
- All data persisted in filesystem or database
- Atomic operations for multi-item changes
- Audit trail for all item state changes
- Backup and restore capabilities

### 5.2 REST API Endpoints
- GET /boards # List user's boards
- POST /boards # Create new board
- GET /boards/{id} # Get board details
- PUT /boards/{id} # Update board settings
- DELETE /boards/{id} # Delete board (if empty)
- GET /boards/{id}/items # List board items
- POST /boards/{id}/items # Add new item
- GET /items/{id} # Get item details
- PUT /items/{id} # Update item
- DELETE /items/{id} # Delete item
- POST /items/{id}/transition # Change item state
- GET /query # Execute complex queries
- GET /metrics/velocity # Team velocity metrics

## 6. Performance Requirements

### 6.1 Response Times
- Board loading: < 200ms for up to 100 items
- Item creation/update: < 100ms
- Query execution: < 500ms for complex queries
- Real-time updates: < 50ms propagation delay

### 6.2 Scalability
- Support up to 1000 items per board
- Support up to 100 boards per user
- Support up to 10 concurrent users per board
- Handle up to 1000 concurrent system users

## 7. Error Handling and Validation

### 7.1 Client-Side Validation
- Form validation with immediate feedback
- Prevent submission of invalid data
- Clear error messages for constraint violations
- Offline support with sync when reconnected

### 7.2 Server-Side Validation
- All business rules enforced on server
- Idempotent operations where possible
- Graceful degradation for partial failures
- Detailed error codes for API consumers

## 8. User Interface Requirements

### 8.1 Board View
- Kanban-style board with columns for each state
- Drag-and-drop for state transitions (respecting rules)
- Visual indicators for WIP limit violations
- Color coding by priority and due date status

## 9. Configuration and Customization

### 9.1 Board Configuration
- Custom WIP limits per board
- Priority levels and color schemes
- Custom fields for items
- Board templates for quick setup

### 9.2 System Configuration
- Default capacity limits
- Session timeout settings
- Email notification templates
- Backup schedule and retention

## 10. Integration Requirements

### 10.1 Import/Export
- Export board data to JSON/CSV
- Import items from CSV with validation
- Backup/restore individual boards
- Integration with external calendar systems for due dates

### 10.2 Notifications
- Email notifications for assignments and due dates
